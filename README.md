# Hi, Iâ€™m Donald Doricent

## ðŸ’» Full-Stack Developer | QA Engineer

I build responsive JavaScript appsâ€”and the test suites that keep them reliable.  
Right now Iâ€™m deepening my React & Node skills through Scrimbaâ€™s Full-Stack program, growing my public QA portfolio with bug reports, test cases, and CI-driven smoke suites, and gearing up for the ISTQB-CTFL exam on July 18, 2025.
